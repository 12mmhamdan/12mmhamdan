# 👋 Hey, I’m Moataz Hamdan

Software Engineer focused on **cloud-native backend systems** and **scalable REST APIs**. I enjoy designing clean service boundaries, modeling data the right way, and optimizing performance so systems stay fast and reliable as they grow.

## Core Strengths
- Cloud-native backend development (containerized services, production-style workloads)
- REST API design (validation, structured error handling, versioned endpoints)
- Data modeling (normalized schemas, constraints, relationships)
- Performance optimization (query tuning, indexing strategies, latency improvements)
- Agile collaboration (planning, standups, code reviews, design discussions)

## Tech Stack

**Languages**
- Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL

**Backend**
- REST APIs, Node.js, Express, Spring

**Frontend**
- React, Angular, HTML, CSS

**Cloud & Infra**
- Google Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Docker

**Databases**
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle

**Tools & Practices**
- Git, Agile/Scrum, CI/CD concepts, API Design
